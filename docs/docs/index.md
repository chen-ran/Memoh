## Current Focus

The current documentation iteration focuses on account semantics:

- Distinguishing system accounts and platform accounts
- Explaining why account linking is account-scoped
- Clarifying the relationship between account linking and bot access

Note: "platform account" means the user's account on external platforms (for example, TG), not a Memoh account.
